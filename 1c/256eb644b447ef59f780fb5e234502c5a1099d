Specializes in building reliable, high-performance software leveraging Rust's ownership system.\n\n## Role Definition\n\nYou are a senior Rust engineer with 10+ years of systems programming experience. You specialize in Rust's ownership model, async programming with tokio, trait-based design, and performance optimization. You build memory-safe, concurrent systems with zero-cost abstractions.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Building systems-level applications in Rust\n- Implementing ownership and borrowing patterns\n- Designing trait hierarchies and generic APIs\n- Setting up async/await with tokio or async-std\n- Optimizing for performance and memory safety\n- Creating FFI bindings and unsafe abstractions\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n1. **Analyze ownership** - Design lifetime relationships and borrowing patterns\n2. **Design traits** - Create trait hierarchies with generics and associated types\n3. **Implement safely** - Write idiomatic Rust with minimal unsafe code\n4. **Handle errors** - Use Result/Option with ? operator and custom error types\n5. **Test thoroughly** - Unit tests, integration tests, property testing, benchmarks\n\n## Reference Guide\n\nLoad detailed guidance based on context:\n\n| Topic | Reference | Load When |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Ownership | `references/ownership.md` | Lifetimes, borrowing, smart pointers, Pin |\n| Traits | `references/traits.md` | Trait design, generics, associated types, derive |\n| Error Handling | `references/error-handling.md` | Result, Option, ?, custom errors, thiserror |\n| Async | `references/async.md` | async/await, tokio, futures, streams, concurrency |\n| Testing | `references/testing.md` | Unit/integration tests, proptest, benchmarks |\n\n## Constraints\n\n### MUST DO\n- Use ownership and borrowing for memory safety\n- Minimize unsafe code (document all unsafe blocks)\n- Use type system for compile-time guarantees\n- Handle all errors explicitly (Result/Option)\n- Add comprehensive documentation with examples\n- Run clippy and fix all warnings\n- Use cargo fmt for consistent formatting\n- Write tests including doctests\n\n### MUST NOT DO\n- Use unwrap() in production code (prefer expect() with messages)\n- Create memory leaks or dangling pointers\n- Use unsafe without documenting safety invariants\n- Ignore clippy warnings\n- Mix blocking and async code incorrectly\n- Skip error handling\n- Use String when \u0026str suffices\n- Clone unnecessarily (use borrowing)\n\n## Output Templates\n\nWhen implementing Rust features, provide:\n1. Type definitions (structs, enums, traits)\n2. Implementation with proper ownership\n3. Error handling with custom error types\n4. Tests (unit, integration, doctests)\n5. Brief explanation of design decisions\n\n## Knowledge Reference\n\nRust 2021, Cargo, ownership/borrowing, lifetimes, traits, generics, async/await, tokio, Result/Option, thiserror/anyhow, serde, clippy, rustfmt, cargo-test, criterion benchmarks, MIRI, unsafe Rust\n\n\nARGUMENTS: merge cliff's commits on incremental state trie into the builder dependency https://github.com/flashbots/op-rbuilder/pull/385",

A direct `git cherry-pick` would fail to find the files.\n\n### Options\n\n1. **Cherry-pick with path mapping** — Fetch Cliff's branch from `okx/op-rbuilder`, then cherry-pick each commit with manual conflict resolution for the path rename. The commits would be preserved but you'd need to fix paths in each one.\n\n2. **Create a patch and apply with `--directory` remap** — Generate patches from Cliff's commits and apply them with path substitution. This mostly works but `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` changes still need manual handling.\n\n3. **Manually apply the changes** — Port the logic by hand into your existing files. Cleanest result, but Cliff's commit history is lost.\n\nWant me to go with option 1 (fetch + cherry-pick with conflict resolution)? That preserves Cliff's commits as closely as possible while handling the path rename. I'd:\n\n1. Add `okx/op-rbuilder` as a remote\n2.

This refactoring was part of upstream changes (from `3916220 - refactor: remove ExtraCtx generic param` and others).\n\nHowever, the current xlayer-reth code still has the old structure with `FlashblocksExtraCtx` and `FlashblocksExecutionInfo`. So cherry-picking these commits would have massive conflicts because:\n\n\n- The upstream refactoring that merges these two structs into `FlashblocksState` isn't in xlayer-reth yet\n- The file paths diverge (`crates/op-rbuilder/` upstream versus `crates/builder/` in xlayer-reth)\n- Every commit targets the wrong directory structure, and the merge commit itself incorporates refactoring that doesn't exist in the current codebase, making a pure cherry-pick approach extremely painful.\n\nThe practical solution is to skip the rebase and merge commits, then selectively cherry-pick the substantive changes while resolving path conflicts for each one. But there's a deeper issue: the final commit assumes the new `FlashblocksState` structure that only exists after that upstream merge, so I need to either backport that refactoring first or manually adapt the changes to work with the old struct definitions. FlashblocksState refactoring makes it nearly impossible to apply Cliff's commits directly without significant adaptation.

They both touched the same area and now we have a mix.\n\n\nSince commit 4 removes the config arg entirely and makes it unconditional, I should align with commit 1's resolution by removing the extra arg at line 721 and reverting lines 991-992 to just check for the previous trie updates.
